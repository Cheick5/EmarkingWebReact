# eMarking Plugin Integration

To integrate this plugin into eMarking, replace the file `marking/index.php` with the contents of `marking/EmarkingWebReact/indexForEasyLoad.php`. This change is necessary due to the imports and the specific names of the JavaScript and CSS files generated by React during the `npm run build` process.

## Running the eMarking Version

To run this version of eMarking, ensure that you have the following directory structure:

```
emarking/marking/EmarkingWebReact
```

Inside the repository folder, use the following command to start:

```bash
npm run build
```

**This is done with build becouse dev runs another server, and moodle hates it*

Happy coding!
