![[Rubric.jsx]]
Is the whole left side of the app.
It contains  the [[Criterion]] and [[Levels]], as well as the [[General Feedback]]
To generate the [[Criterion]] we set the [[ajaxSubmission]] rubric  tag to a variable and then map it. 
The map makes a call to [[Level]], and that initializes both [[Criterion]] and [[Levels]]
